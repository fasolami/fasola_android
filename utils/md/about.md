# About

FaSoLa Minutes is an app for Android and iOS that that offers new ways to view and search the minutes of Sacred Harp singings from _The Sacred Harp: 1991 Edition_ since 1995. You can use the app to identify the song that's been stuck in your head all morning, learn more about the favorite songs of your singing friends, read up on a singing you hope to attend, decide on a song to lead when the one you were planning on singing has already been used, and much more.

All proceeds benefit the [Sacred Harp Musical Heritage Association](http://fasola.org/shmha/), a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization whose purpose is the preservation and perpetuation of Sacred Harp singing and its traditions.
