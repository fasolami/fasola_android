### Searching

leader name, song name and page number, or singing name and location.
Some screens have more search options.  For instance, the [song list](song_list)
also allows you to search by composer, poet, and lyrics.

### Sorting

Tap **sort** ![](ic_action_sort_by_size) to see a list of sorting options.

Where headings are shown, the number of items in that group is displayed to
the right of the heading.  For instance, when sorting songs by key signature, you
can see that there are 57 songs in A Major and 35 songs in A Minor.
