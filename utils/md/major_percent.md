# Major/minor percent

The [leader detail](leader_activity) screen lists a the percent of leads that are major or minor.  When interpreting this figure, it is important to know that _The Sacred Harp, 1991 Edition_ contains 72% major tunes (or 28% minor).

A leader who leads 70% major tunes is selecting proportionately from the book's major and minor tunes.  A leader who leads 50% major shows a preference for minor tunes (compared to a random sample of the book).
